# The Natural Biometrician

This will serve as a repo of ideas for the creation and brainstorming of a world class open forest management model.  This will be in support of:

[Forest.NaturalBiometrician.org/](https://forest.naturalbiometrician.org/)

I am an individual (hence THE) where I am trying to build a community that is the Natural Biometrician Project.  I have spent years thinking about this and trying to promote it.  Time to take a new approach now that the landscape has changed.
